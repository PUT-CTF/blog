      <description>Intro First we notice that color square is added for every three letters in text to encrypt. At the end of image we have n mod 3 two-decimal hex numbers. Also, color of previous squares didn&amp;rsquo;t change if we add more letters. Knowing that the flag must be in format flag{md5hash} we have tried encrypt flag{x
And we get what we want to. RGB code of the first color was exactly the same as the color of the flag, and also second color had only different blue value in comprasion with the flag.</description>

      <description>Website Attack (200) - 17 solves Our website received an attack in 2013, we managed to capture the attack in this pcap. Can you find out if we leaked some sensitive information?  The beginning - Wireshark problem After opening the provided pcap file in Wireshark, we could see that there&amp;rsquo;s a problem. Besides tcp packets, there were some malformed ones - which under closer inspection turned out to be named GSM over IP.</description>
